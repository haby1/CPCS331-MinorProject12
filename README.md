**Draw a semantic networks, and query through it.**

Implementing Semantic Nets for Knowledge Representation

Objective:

To understand the principles of semantic nets, their benefits in knowledge representation, and their practical applications in AI.

Practical Implementation:

1. Design a Semantic Net:
* Choose a domain of interest (e.g., a zoo, a university, a hospital).
* Sketch or diagram a semantic net representing the chosen domain. Ensure to label the nodes and links appropriately.
2. Implementation:
* Choose a programming language (e.g., Python, Java, Prolog).
* Implement the designed semantic net using the chosen language. You may use libraries or frameworks that assist in graph operations.
3. Basic Operations:
* Implement functions to add nodes and relationships to the net.
* Implement functions to remove nodes and relationships.
* Implement a search/query function to retrieve specific nodes,relationships, or patterns.
4. Advanced Implementation:
* Incorporate basic inference mechanisms to derive new knowledge from the existing net.
* Handle ambiguities or conflicts in the information.
5. Future of Semantic Nets:
* Reflect on the future potential of semantic nets in the evolving landscape of AI and knowledge representation.
6. Evaluation Criteria:
* Depth of theoretical understanding.
* Quality and complexity of the semantic net design.
* Functionality and efficiency of the implemented code.
* Quality of reflection and analysis.
* Presentation skills (if opted for the presentation).
